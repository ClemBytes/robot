# Robot project

## Where can I see what it does?

On my website here: [robot.clembytes.fr](https://robot.clembytes.fr)

## Where can I follow the process

On my blog here: [clembytes](https://clembytes.fr/)

And more specifically the following articles: [clembytes.fr/category/robot](https://clembytes.fr/category/robot/)

## The idea

Move a little robot. But it's an excuse for working on basic programming skills. So to add more fun, I am doing it in C, using only the standard library.

## Support

You can contact me about this project or my work at <clembytes@proton.me>.

## Roadmap

Here is what I plan to do in the future on this project:
- Add cookies for managing different clients
- Use some JavaScript for more interactivity
- Add possibility to write a small list of instructions to follow

## Project status

Ongoing work!
